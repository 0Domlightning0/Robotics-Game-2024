## Dom's Thoughts
- In 2023 our fastest travel time across the field was 2.2 sec (meep meep), I dont see robots getting there faster than 2.5 sec with other robots
- I dont believe that more than 16 cycles (32 points) from the source is possible, this would require consistant cycles faster than 7 sec
- Travel speed and Consistancy(Shot conversion) were the variables that made the most impact
- Hoarding/Planning is nessesary when trying to fully use a boost
- With the average Ontario bot scoring 4-7 pieces per game, the co-operatition button is likely nessesary
- The game piece RP is always lacking
